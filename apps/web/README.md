# Web App

This package now hosts a minimal Next.js app so Vercel has a concrete target to build and deploy. The placeholder page:

- Confirms the project is wired up correctly.
- Points players toward the Colyseus server (`apps/server`) while the real client is under construction.

When you replace this with the production client, keep the build scripts intact so CI and Vercel continue to work.
